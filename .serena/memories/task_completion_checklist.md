# Task Completion Checklist

When completing a development task in this project, follow these steps:

## 1. Code Changes
- [ ] Make necessary code changes in the appropriate files
- [ ] Follow the project's coding style and conventions
- [ ] Ensure Korean comments/strings where appropriate for user-facing content
- [ ] Update any related view models, managers, or data models

## 2. Dependency Management
If dependencies were added or modified:
```bash
mise x -- tuist install
```

## 3. Project Regeneration
After changes to `Project.swift` or Tuist manifests:
```bash
mise x -- tuist generate
```

## 4. Build Verification
Verify the project builds successfully:
```bash
mise x -- tuist build
```

## 5. Testing
If tests exist and are relevant:
```bash
mise x -- tuist test
```
Note: Currently AppTests target is empty, so manual testing may be required.

## 6. Version Management
For release tasks:
- [ ] Update `MARKETING_VERSION` in `Projects/App/Configs/debug.xcconfig` (or release.xcconfig)
- [ ] Build number will be auto-incremented by Fastlane during deployment

## 7. Secret Files
If you modified any secret files:
```bash
git secret hide
```

## 8. Git Workflow
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "descriptive message in Korean or English"
git push
```

## 9. CI/CD (if deploying)
For TestFlight deployment:
```bash
fastlane ios release description:'변경사항 설명' isReleasing:false
```

For App Store submission:
```bash
fastlane ios release description:'변경사항 설명' isReleasing:true
```

## Common Issues to Check

### Before Committing
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] Xcode project files are gitignored (generated by Tuist)
- [ ] No uncommitted changes in Tuist manifests that affect builds
- [ ] Dark mode UI considerations (app uses dark mode)

### Before Deploying
- [ ] Firebase configuration is correct
- [ ] AdMob unit IDs are correct
- [ ] KakaoTalk integration works
- [ ] Network security exceptions are only for necessary domains
- [ ] Code signing certificates and provisioning profiles are valid

## Linting and Formatting
Since there's no automated linting/formatting:
- [ ] Manually review code for consistency with existing style
- [ ] Check for proper use of Swift naming conventions
- [ ] Ensure proper indentation and spacing

## Documentation
- [ ] Add inline comments for complex logic
- [ ] Update relevant memory files if architecture changes
- [ ] Korean comments for business logic, English for technical details (as appropriate)
